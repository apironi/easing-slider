# [Easing Slider](http://easingslider.com)

### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Creating sliders with WordPress has always been a tricky business. Every plugin developed to provide a solution has never really hit the mark in our opinion, and Easing Slider aims to fix that. This plugin focuses on achieving it's core purpose - creating & managing sliders with ease, with anything additional provided through extensions. It aims to make creating sliders simple, without a major learning curve.
